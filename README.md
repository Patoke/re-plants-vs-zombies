## re-plants-vs-zombies
This project aims to rebuild the GOTY version of the game Plants Vs Zombies by PopCap via reverse engineering

This project is based off of another project from: [Kopie](https://github.com/rspforhp), all credits to her

# How to install?
Firstly you will need to build the project, this is as simple as opening the solution, selecting the build type as "ReleaseVS2005" and pressing build

After that you will end up with an executable named "LawnProject.exe" inside "SexyAppFramework->ReleaseVS2005"

In the folder with the executable you will need to drop the original game files from the latest steam version of the game

These files are "main.pak", "bass.dll" and the "properties" folder
